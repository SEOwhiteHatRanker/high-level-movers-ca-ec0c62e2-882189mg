We offer free, no-obligation in-home or virtual estimates so you get an accurate quote before moving day. As a thank you to our senior clients, we do provide a senior discount—please mention your eligibility when booking so we can apply it to your estimate."

We recommend booking at least 2-4 weeks in advance, especially during peak moving months (May through September), to ensure your preferred date is available.

                <div class="testimonial">
                    <div class="testimonial-text">I hired High Level Movers when my mother needed to move into a seniors' residence here in Cochrane. The guys showed up right on time and handled her furniture with extra care, which I really appreciated since some of it belonged to her parents. They even took apart her old bed frame and put it back together at her new place. The only hiccup was one small scratch on a dresser, but they pointed it out right away and offered to help fix it. Overall, their kindness and patience made a stressful day much easier for Mom (and me). Would definitely recommend for other families moving seniors.</div>

                <div class="testimonial">
                    <div class="testimonial-text">We used High Level Movers Calgary for my wife's aunt's downsizing move in February. They were really respectful and didn't rush her, even though she was having a hard time letting go of some things. The crew packed everything up on a Wednesday morning, and by mid-afternoon they had her settled in the new apartment. They also suggested a charity in Calgary that would pick up the extra furniture, which was a nice bonus. Very professional, and you can tell they've helped a lot of seniors before.</div>

                    <div class="testimonial-text">My brother and I booked High Level Movers for our dad's move from his house to a retirement condo. They communicated well beforehand, which helped us plan, since my brother was coming in from out of town. The movers were friendly and didn't mind answering Dad's questions. Only thing I wish is that they'd had more packing material for some fragile dishes, but otherwise all went smoothly. Price was fair and there were no surprises. Would use again.</div>

                        <div class="faq-answer">Our pricing for senior moves in Cochrane is based on several factors, including the size of your home, the number of belongings, access to the property (such as stairs or elevators), and the distance to your new location. We offer free, no-obligation in-home or virtual estimates so you get an accurate quote before moving day. As a thank you to our senior clients, we do provide a senior discount—please mention your eligibility when booking so we can apply it to your estimate.</div>

                        <div class="faq-answer">Most senior moves within Cochrane can be completed in a single day, depending on the volume of items and any additional services needed (like packing or storage). We recommend booking at least 2-4 weeks in advance, especially during peak moving months (May through September), to ensure your preferred date is available. If you need to move on shorter notice, please contact us—our team will do our best to accommodate your schedule.</div>

                        <summary>What does your senior moving process look like, and do you offer packing and unpacking services?</summary>
                        <div class="faq-answer">Our senior moving process starts with a personalized consultation, either in-person or virtually, to assess your needs. We can provide full-service packing and unpacking, carefully labeling boxes and organizing items for easy settling into your new home. On moving day, our trained movers use specialized equipment—like furniture dollies with extra padding and floor runners—to ensure safety and prevent damage. If you need help setting up furniture or arranging belongings in your new place, we’re happy to assist.</div>

All moves are covered by our comprehensive insurance, but we go a step further for senior moves by offering additional packing protection for fragile and sentimental items.

If you have specific concerns or high-value items, let us know during your consultation so we can plan accordingly and provide extra peace of mind.</div>
