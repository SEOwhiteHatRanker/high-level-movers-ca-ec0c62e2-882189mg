      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Our pricing for piano and specialty item moves in Strathmore varies depending on the type of item, its size and weight, the distance between locations, and any special handling requirements (such as stairs or narrow hallways). For upright pianos, local moves within Strathmore typically start around $300-$400, while baby grand or grand pianos may cost more due to their size and complexity. Specialty items like safes or antiques are quoted individually. For an accurate estimate, please contact us with the details of your item and both addresses."

We conduct a pre-move assessment—either in-person or by detailed photos—to plan the safest route and determine if special equipment (like piano boards, stair climbers, or hoisting straps) is needed. On moving day, we protect floors and doorways, securely wrap the item, and use the necessary gear to ensure safe and damage-free transport, even in homes with narrow staircases or tight corners."

While incidents are rare, we do offer a satisfaction guarantee and are fully insured. If any damage occurs during the move, we will work with you promptly to repair or compensate for the item based on the insurance coverage in place. Please keep in mind that we encourage discussing any existing damage or concerns before the move so we can provide the best protection possible."

                <div class="testimonial">
                    <div class="testimonial-text">I called High Level Movers when I needed to get my old upright piano moved from my house to my daughter's place across town. The guys showed up right when they said they would (which is rare these days!) and took a lot of care wrapping the piano up. It’s pretty sentimental to me, so I was a bit nervous, but they were gentle and didn’t rush. The only hiccup was a bit of confusion about the stairs at my daughter's place, but they worked it out. Piano arrived with no scratches, and they even suggested a better spot for it in her living room. Definitely recommend if you have something delicate to move.</div>

                <div class="testimonial">
                    <div class="testimonial-text">Moved a big old grandfather clock plus a few antiques with these folks last weekend. Booking was easy, and they called to confirm a day beforehand, which I appreciated. The movers did nick the wall on the way out with the clock, but they patched it up for me before leaving. All my stuff made it in one piece and they set the clock up at the new place, even helped me get it level. Solid service overall, just not quite perfect.</div>

                    <div class="testimonial-text">Had to move my baby grand from my basement (never again!) and was honestly dreading it. High Level Movers sent three guys who really knew what they were doing—took it apart, packed every piece, and carried it up those nightmare basement stairs without a single complaint. The whole thing took about 3 hours, which was faster than I expected. They were super professional and even showed me some little scratches I never noticed before, just to be upfront. Good experience and would use them again if I ever move (hopefully not for a while!).</div>

                        <div class="faq-answer">Yes, High Level Movers Calgary is fully licensed and insured to operate in Alberta, including Strathmore.

                        <summary>What is your process for safely moving a piano or specialty item in Strathmore homes with stairs or tight spaces?</summary>
                        <div class="faq-answer">Our team specializes in moving large and delicate items through challenging spaces. We conduct a pre-move assessment—either in-person or by detailed photos—to plan the safest route and determine if special equipment (like piano boards, stair climbers, or hoisting straps) is needed. On moving day, we protect floors and doorways, securely wrap the item, and use the necessary gear to ensure safe and damage-free transport, even in homes with narrow staircases or tight corners.</div>

                        <summary>Do you guarantee the safety of my piano or specialty item during the move, and what happens if there is damage?</summary>
                        <div class="faq-answer">We take every precaution to protect your piano or specialty item, and our movers are highly trained in handling delicate and valuable pieces. While incidents are rare, we do offer a satisfaction guarantee and are fully insured. If any damage occurs during the move, we will work with you promptly to repair or compensate for the item based on the insurance coverage in place. Please keep in mind that we encourage discussing any existing damage or concerns before the move so we can provide the best protection possible.</div>
