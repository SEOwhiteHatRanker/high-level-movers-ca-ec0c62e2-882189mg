        "text": "Our pricing for furniture disassembly and reassembly is based on the number and complexity of the items involved, as well as the total labor time required. For most moves in Chestermere, we provide a detailed estimate after a walkthrough or inventory list is provided. If you have specialty items like large wardrobes, beds with integrated storage, or custom furniture, please let us knowâ€”these may require additional time and tools, which we'll factor into your quote. There are no hidden charges; your estimate will clearly outline all costs."

                <div class="testimonial">
                    <div class="testimonial-text">Honestly, I was nervous about moving my big sectional and the ancient china cabinet (itâ€™s been in my family for ages). I called High Level Movers because a friend recommended them, and they didnâ€™t disappoint. The guys showed up actually a few minutes early and got right to work. They took apart the couch and the cabinet super carefully, and I watched them label every little screw and hinge so nothing got lost. At the new house, they reassembled everythingâ€”no scratches, no wobbling. Even helped me get the sofa through this narrow hallway I dreaded. Took a bit longer than I expected, but worth the peace of mind. Definitely a solid moving crew.</div>

                <div class="testimonial">
                    <div class="testimonial-text">Moved a 2-bed apartment last month within Chestermere. Chose High Level Movers because they offered to disassemble my bed and the babyâ€™s crib. The movers were polite and wrapped everything up well. I docked a star because they forgot one of the bolts for the bed frame, but they came back the next day and fixed it up without charging extra. All in all, pretty satisfied.</div>

                    <div class="testimonial-text">I donâ€™t usually leave reviews but these folks were a life-saver. I had to move on short notice for work, and my old IKEA furniture always gives me trouble. High Level Movers handled all the disassembly and put everything back together at my new place in one afternoonâ€”dresser, two bookcases, and my king bed. There was a small scratch on my nightstand, but I can live with it. Overall, super friendly and efficient team. Would use them again.</div>

                        <div class="faq-answer">Our pricing for furniture disassembly and reassembly is based on the number and complexity of the items involved, as well as the total labor time required. For most moves in Chestermere, we provide a detailed estimate after a walkthrough or inventory list is provided. If you have specialty items like large wardrobes, beds with integrated storage, or custom furniture, please let us knowâ€”these may require additional time and tools, which we'll factor into your quote. There are no hidden charges; your estimate will clearly outline all costs.</div>

                        <div class="faq-answer">Typically, furniture disassembly and reassembly for a standard three-bedroom home in Chestermere takes between 2 to 4 hours, depending on the types of furniture and the access in your home. We always aim to complete these tasks efficiently on moving day, so your belongings are ready for transport and set up in your new place as quickly as possible. For larger homes or moves with multiple bulky or intricate pieces, we may recommend starting the process the day before moving.</div>
